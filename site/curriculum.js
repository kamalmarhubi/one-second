            When I see code like this, I think about how much time a millisecond is 
            -- it's imperceptible to me, but apparently you can run 68,000,000
            iterations of an empty loop in a millisecond, even in Python!

         many elements can we add to a dictionary in Python in a second?</p>

        Once you've gotten that one, let's look at a more complicated operation

            We can parse 25,000 small HTTP requests per second! One thing I want to
            point out here is that the request parsing code is written in pure Python,
            not C -- so we can actually do a quite nontrivial amount of work in
            40 microseconds.

            Starting a program is actually already expensive by itself, not just starting Python.
            If we just run /bin/true, we can do 500 of them in a second, so it looks like
            running any program has about 1ms of overhead. The cost of downloading a webpage of course
            depends a lot the size, connection speed, and distance from the servers, 
            and we're not going to get further into network performance 
            (network performance is SO INTERESTING). Friends who do high performance networking
            say it's possible to get network roundtrips of 250ns (!!!), 
            but that's with much closer computers, and fancier hardware.
            For us and Google, it's a million times longer </3.
            Light can only travel a foot in a nanosecond, and Google is much more than 250 feet away.

            How many bytes can you write to disk in a second? We all know writing
            to memory is faster, but how *much* faster? This code was run on a
            computer with an SSD

            Disks are slower than memory, and this matters even if you're using a 'slow' language like Python,
            and if you have an extremely fast disk (my SSD has been known to write at > 500MB/s, which is *fast*).
            A lot of things end up being dominated by disk speed. We'll see that in the next example!

            <p>
            Note when doing this one that the bytes grep is reading are already in memory.
            This will give us an idea of
            how much of grep's slowness is because of the search
            time required, and how much is because it needs to read from disk.

            Serialization is a pretty common place to spend a lot of time, and
            it can really hurt, especially if you end up serializing/deserializing
            the same data repeatedly.
            Here are a couple of benchmarks: of parsing 64K of JSON, and the
            same data encoded in <a href="//msgpack.org">msgpack</a> format.

            Basically every single person we talked to about serialization mentioned that capnproto
            does instant serialization. We just want you to know that deserializing
            64K of data can take a millisecond (a LONG TIME, as we now know), and
            that your choice of format and library makes a big difference.

            DATABASES. We don't have anything fancy like PostgreSQL for you,

            Not a big surprise: indexes are amazing. 20ish microseconds for an indexed query
            means that if this were over a network to a faraway database server,
            the time to query would be dominated by the network roundtrip time to the server.

            Next up, let's talk about memory access. CPUs these days have L1 and L2 caches,
            which are much faster to access than main memory. This means that accessing memory
            sequentially (where the CPU can load a bunch of data into a cache) will normally give you faster code than
            accessing memory out of order.
            </p>
            <p>
            Let's see how that shakes out in practice! You might want to refer to 
            <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know</a>
            to guess at this one.

        'conclusion': `
            We don't write a lot of C, so this doesn't affect us very often.
            But if you care about how many nanoseconds your operations take
            (which you do if you're trying to do a billion things a second, which computers can),
            you care about this kind of thing a lot.
